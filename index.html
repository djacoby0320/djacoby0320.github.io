                        Git is software that is used as a version control system. This tracks changes in files and coordinates work on said files amongst multiple people.

                        Github is a website where users of git can store repositories for programming projects they are working on.

                        A repository is a directory of files related to a project. Different versions of the project can be saved, and accessed as well.

                        I think Github is a wonderful resource for programmers, and developers. It allows multiple people to work on the same files using version control. It is a very powerful tool that has made development much easier and less time consuming.
